In‪ our execution of the Boggle game, we've added some extra functionalities
to make the game more exiting and user friendly.
The following sections will describe the additional features we've added:‬

‪Winning the game - In our execution it is possible to win the game.
If a user finds all the valid words within the board, before the time runs out,
the game will stop and show a winning message to the player.
Finding all the valid words doesn't necessarily mean that the user received the max possible amount of points.
It might be possible to find the same words in different lengths of paths.‬

‪Lives - In our execution a user can guess non-valid words only a certain amount of times.
The user is starting the game with a default amount of lives,
and each time that the user will guess a word that is not in the valid words list, the user will lose one life.
When the user will get to 0 lives, the game will stop and show a game-over message to the user.
The lives are visually represented on the game by symbols of red hearts in the main screen.‬

‪Quit game - In our execution a user can quit and close the game anytime in an easy way.
A specific button that closes the game is clearly located on the main board.   ‬

‪Game messages - In our execution the user will get messages according to the situation of the game.
The game will tell the user when a non-valid word was inserted.
The game will also tell the user when a valid word was inserted and what is the amount of points the user gained because of it.  ‬

‪Hints - In our execution a user can also ask for a hint.
A specific button for hints is placed on the main board, but can be pressed only when no letters have been inserted.
The hint will search for a valid word that hasn't been inserted yet,
and will change the color of the first letter for a short time.
In this way the user will be able to see the first letter of the word and try to guess the rest of it.        ‬
